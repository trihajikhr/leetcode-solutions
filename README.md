# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains a collection of solutions to various programming problems from **LeetCode**. The main purpose of this repository is to serve as personal documentation as well as a reference for studying algorithmic patterns, data structures, and problem-solving techniques commonly used in competitive programming and software development.

## Repository Goals

* Store solutions across different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* Record concise and structured approaches for each problem.
* Serve as a learning archive for algorithms and data structures.
* Provide clean, runnable, and easy-to-understand code examples.

## Programming Language

All solutions are written in C++. It is one of the strongest languages in competitive programming due to its performance and flexibility. However, a good programmer should not be overly constrained by language choice; logic, reasoning, and intuition are far more important. Differences in syntax may exist, but the underlying approach to problem-solving should remain largely the same.
